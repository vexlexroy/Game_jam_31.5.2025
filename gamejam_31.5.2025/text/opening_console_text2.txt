Received: Hello, I am Sparrow, a robot test assistant. As you can see (well *can't* see technically), you are left in your testing chamber without any stimulus to guide your adaptible mechanisms. I shall assist you.
Received: I shall lend you my sight so you can navigate to the first data set by yourself. It would be wise to not waste time, thus I may send you the information of your history later.
